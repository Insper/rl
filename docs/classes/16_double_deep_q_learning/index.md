# Double Deep Q-Learning

The goals of this section are:

* discuss the definitions and key concepts related to Double Deep Q-Learning; 
* understand the differences between Deep Q-Learning and Double Deep Q-Learning, and; 
* implement a Double Deep Q-Learning algorithm and compare the results with Deep Q-Learning. 

However, instead of having boring lectures, all students are invited to read the following paper: 

* van Hasselt, H., Guez, A. and Silver, D. 2016. Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-Learning. Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 30, 1 (Mar. 2016). DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v30i1.10295](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v30i1.10295).

and understand the main topics. The main topics of this activity are described [here](../../projects/project_01.md). This is our first major project in this subject.
