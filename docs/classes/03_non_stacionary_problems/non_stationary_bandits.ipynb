The environment is created using the library `buffalo_gym` and the environment is `Buffalo-v0` with `dynamic_rate=100`. The environment has 10 arms and the rewards are generated from a normal distribution. The rewards are non-stationary, meaning that the mean of the rewards changes over time. The algorithm will be tested for 1000 steps and the average reward will be plotted over time."
