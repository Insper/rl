# Student Assessment

Student assessment will be conducted through **exercises**, **projects**, and an **individual final evaluation**.

* Multiple **exercises** will be completed throughout the semester. The simple average of these implementations defines 30% of the final course grade.
* **One project** will be completed. The grade of this project defines 50% of the final course grade. The project will be developed in pairs, and the grade will be the same for both students in the pair. The project will be evaluated based on the quality of the implementation, the results obtained, and the quality of the report. The students will delivery different artifacts for the project along the semester.
* The **individual final evaluation** defines 20% of the final course grade.

**The approval criteria are**:

* final grade greater than or equal to five (5);
* the concept of the individual final evaluation must be greater than or equal to **Basic (C)**;
* and 75% minimum attendance in classes.

## Concept to Numeric Value Conversion

The result of some evaluations may adopt concepts (A+, B,..., I) instead of a numeric value. For these cases, the following conversion table will be used:

| A+ | A | B | C | D | I |
|----|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | 9 | 7 | 5 | 4 | 2 |

* **Insufficient (I)**: did not submit, submitted something that did not require effort, or deviated from the objective.
* **In Development (D)**: submitted something that was in accordance with the objective and required some effort, but has important problems and limitations. The minimum acceptable standard was not met.
* **Basic (C)**: the minimum acceptable standard for the measured objective was achieved, but the performance was below expected. It is sufficient for approval.
* **Expected (B)**: achieved the expected performance.
* **Advanced (A)**: performance was above expected. This is desirable, but is not a cause for concern if not achieved.
