# Learning Goals

At the end of the course, the student should be able to:

1. build a Reinforcement Learning (RL) system for sequential decision-making;
1. understand how to formalize their task as a Reinforcement Learning problem, and how to implement a solution;
1. understand the space of RL algorithms (Sarsa, Q-learning, Policy Gradients, and more), and;
1. understand how RL fits under the broader umbrella of machine learning, and how it complements supervised and unsupervised learning.
